	My Story</strong></h1>

<h3 style="color: #651E5C;"> 
I could never pick a favorite academic subject when I was younger, but I always liked art. Although unconventional and not ideal for a colored middle class female such as myself, I chose to pursue it. <q>Pick something you like and enjoy doing,</q> is the advice I would always receive from counselors and the like. However, my family was a more traditional minded household who believed in aiming for fields such as medicine/healthcare, law/government, or anything that had a bright prospective outlook financially. Of course this way of thinking wasn’t a bad idea, but it prevented me from freely moving towards something I truly loved doing rather than something I just thought I should be doing. In college, I started exploring my options and mustered the courage to take a design course. Out of all my classes, design was something I was the most interested in. It felt like design was something I could love doing and I didn’t want to give this opportunity up. So, I did it and applied to the major as I pursued a BFA in Design. <q>What will I be creating? What will I be doing with my future? How will I stay stable financially?</q> were all questions I thought and received. Despite all this uneasiness, I still decided to stick with my major. I have a few goals in mind for my future but who really knows how it will end up playing out? I guess you can never really know for sure. All I knew was that I felt something in those classes while I was thinking and creating. I wanted to share this feeling with others who wanted to spread their own messages or ideas. Let the world see you. Let me help you make them feel and understand what they see.
